        <h2> Future Trek for Paytm</h2>
        
        <p> The next period of Mercury-Moon from May'2018 upto October'2019 can be seen as the period of steady growth for the company. The company should think about some new plans and strategies for consumers in this timeframe for continued aggressive growth. Navmansha chart indicates that the company might take some interest in communication sector too, in the coming sub period of Mars upto October'2020.
        </p>

        <p> In future, Paytm would diversify in ventures that are related to Communication, Education, Network providing companies. In Navmansha chart, Sun is placed in the 6<sup>th</sup> house, therefore the upcoming Mercury-Sun period isn't much conducive for ESOPs and bigger players would emerge to overshadow Paytm. </p>
