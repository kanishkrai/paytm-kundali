    <h2> Future Stakes </h2>
        <p> In 2015, Paytm became the first Indian company to receive funding from Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba, after it raised over $625 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. The Alibaba Group was the biggest stakeholder in Paytm's parent company One97 Communications. Paytm has dynamically leaped the growth ladder due to the fructification of "Vipreet Raj Yoga" in the 8th house of hidden treasure in the MERCURY- VENUS period.</p>

        <p>In August 2016, Paytm received an investment from Mountain Capital, one of Taiwan-based MediaTekâ€™s investment funds valued at $4.8 Billion. They are also talking with Softbank to raise $1.9 Billion. These investments made exponential growth of the company and also helped them making a household name for quick and safe transactions.
