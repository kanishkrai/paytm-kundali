    <h2> Paytm's Funding Saga </h2>
        <p> In 2015, Paytm's eCommerce wing became the first Indian company to receive funding from largest ecommerce giant <em>Alibaba</em>, after it raised over $625 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. The Alibaba Group was the biggest stakeholder in Paytm's parent company One97 Communications. Paytm has dynamically leaped the growth ladder due to the fructification of <b>Vipreeta Raj Yoga</b> in the 8<sup>th</sup> house of hidden treasure in the Mercury-Venus period.</p>

        <p>In August 2016, Paytm received an investment from Mountain Capital, one of Taiwan-based MediaTekâ€™s investment funds valued at $4.8 Billion. They have also raised $1.4 Billion from Softbank for the banking wing, at a valuation of around $8 Billion. These investments have brought in exponential growth to the company and have created Paytm's digital wallet as a household name and an alternate and a safer way to pay!
